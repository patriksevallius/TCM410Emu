# TCM410Emu
A MIPS emulator for the TCM410 Cable Modem Router

Currently not 100% working.

What works:
 - Bootloader
 - Flash detection
 - SDRAM size detection
 - Loading of program image
 - LZMA decompression
 - CPU ID detection
 - Partial vxWorks startup


It currently stops after trying to bring up the DOCSIS interface
